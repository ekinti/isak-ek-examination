  The Lighthouse is a 2019 film directed and produced by Robert Eggers, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother, Max Eggers. The movie was released by the well renowned production company A24. It was an international co-production of the United States and Canada, with the film being shot in a very unconventional black-and-white color palette with a nearly square 1.19:1 aspect ratio. Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson star as two lighthouse keepers who begin to descend into madness when a storm strands them on the remote island where they are stationed. Director Eggers has stated that "I'm more about questions than answers in this movie.". For the most part, "The Lighthouse" takes place inside the mind of lighthouse keeper prodigy Ephraim Winslow, and through his weeks of agony on the lonesome volcanic rock the story becomes more and more hallucinatory. Even compared to other psychological thrillers this movie is avant garde, with scattered religious and ancient imagery all over the place.

  "A gripping story brilliantly filmed and led by a pair of powerhouse performances, The Lighthouse further establishes Robert Eggers as a filmmaker of exceptional talent." <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" class="sourcelink" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lighthouse_2019" target="_blank">- Rotten Tomatoes</a>  <br> <br> "By turns funny, sinister, haunting, historically fascinating and mythical, “The Lighthouse” is one of the best films of the year." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" class="sourcelink" href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/17/the-lighthouse-is-one-of-the-best-films-of-the-year/" target="_blank">- New York Post </a><br> <br> "‘The Lighthouse’ is at its strongest when it resembles the dark comedy of a Beckett play, complete with earthy scatological humor … my admiration for the director’s mastery of craft had given way to impatience." <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" class="sourcelink" href="https://slate.com/culture/2019/10/the-lighthouse-movie-review-robert-pattinson-horror-farts.html" target="_blank"> - Slate</a> <br> <br> "Apart from everything else, this is a sublime film visually: Eggers and Blaschke imagine a glorious variety of images from this stark and unforgiving place. Very few films can make you scared and excited at the same time. Just like the lighthouse beam, this is dazzling and dangerous." <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" class="sourcelink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/19/the-lighthouse-review-robert-pattinson-shines-in-sublime-maritime-nightmare" target="_blank"> - The Guardian</a> <br> <br>
