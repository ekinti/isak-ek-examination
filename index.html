<p class = "troll"> (Thomas Wake STANDS UP, SAYS TO Ephraim Winslow)

  Let Neptune strike ye dead, Winslow!
  
  (Thomas Wake CLOSES EYES, POINTS FACE SKYWARD, BALLS FISTS) 
  
  Haaaaark! Hark, Triton! Hark!
  
  Bellow, bid our father, the sea king, rise from the depths, full foul
  
  in his fury, black waves teeming with salt-foam, to smother
  
  this young mouth with pungent slime…
  
  (Thomas Wake OPENS EYES, LOOKS TOWARDS Ephraim Winslow) 
  
  … to choke ye, engorging your organs till ye turn blue and
  
  bloated with bilge and brine and can scream no more…
  
  only when he, crowned in cockle shells with
  
  slithering tentacled tail and steaming beard,
  
  take up his fell, be-finnèd arm — his coral-tined trident
  
  screeches banshee-like in the tempest and plunges right through yer gullet,
  
  bursting ye, a bulging bladder no more,
  
  but a blasted bloody film now — a nothing
  
  for the Harpies and the souls of dead sailors to peck and claw and feed
  
  upon only to be lapped up and swallowed by the infinite waters of
  
  the dread emperor himself…
  
  forgotten to any man, to any time, forgotten to any god or devil,
  
  forgotten even to the sea… for any stuff or part of Winslow, even
  
  any scantling of your soul, is Winslow no more, but is now itself
  
  the sea.
  
  (Thomas Wake TREMBLES, AWAITING Ephraim Winslow’s RESPONSE)</p>
